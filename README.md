# Root Access – C# OOP Hacking Simulation Game

Root Access is a console-based cybersecurity-themed hacking simulation game developed as an academic project for the Object-Oriented Programming course.

## Project Overview
The game allows a player to complete multiple hacking challenges to gain system access. It progresses through three main levels:
1. Password Cracking
2. Firewall Bypass
3. System Exploit

Each level demonstrates different Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through real gameplay logic.

## Project Goals
- Apply core OOP concepts in a practical project
- Build a modular and extensible architecture
- Simulate real-world cybersecurity-style tasks
- Implement advanced OOP features such as:
  - Abstract classes
  - Interfaces
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Virtual and overridden methods
  - Operator and function overloading
  - Copy constructors
  - Static fields and methods

## System Architecture
- **IScorable** (Interface)
- **HackChallenge** (Abstract Base Class)
- **Derived Classes**
  - PasswordCracking
  - FirewallBypass
  - SystemExploit
- **HackingGame** (Game Controller)
- **Program** (Main Entry Point)

## Game Flow
1. Game starts at Level 1
2. Appropriate challenge is generated
3. User attempts until success
4. Score is calculated based on attempts
5. Player progresses to Levels 2 and 3
6. Final game statistics are displayed

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C#
- Framework: .NET
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Run the following command in terminal:

```bash
dotnet run
